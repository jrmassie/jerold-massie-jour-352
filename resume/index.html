    <h3 class="aboutme">About Me</h3>
      <p class="about">I am an up-and-coming multimedia journalist who loves telling unique and interesting stories in new and engaging ways.

      <p class="about">I began my foyer into journalism at the end of my time in community college before interning at a local news website in Southern Maryland. I was offered a job at the end of the summer and decided to take a year off of school and gained valuable experience. I covered government meetings, sports, courts, crime, elections and more.</p>

      <p class="about">I have multiple years of experience writing articles and producing video and audio content. I also have experience with photojournalism and livestreaming production.</p>

      <p class="about">After my time in local news, I decided to finish my degree at the University of Maryland's Merrill College of Journalism. I will graduate in the spring of 2022 with a BA in Multimedia Journalism and a Tech Entrepreneurship Minor.</p>

      <p class="about">In college, I created two of my favorite pieces of journalism in "The Perfect Crime" and "Dueling Monuments." Both are audio stories that cover topics I became more and more intrigued with as I interviewed and read more about them. They both tell unique stories on popular topics. I adore them because they are the kinds of stories that inspired me to become a journalist.</p>
