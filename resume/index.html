  <p>I am a multimedia journalist based in Washington D.C. I have covered everything from sports to courts and crime. My favorite stories are those with strong characters that either tells a story that hasn’t been told before or shines a new light on an existing event or idea.</p>

    <p>At Thompson Creek, I provide exceptional customer service by assessing client needs, troubleshooting issues, and offering comprehensive, tailored solutions. I engage potential customers by adapting communication style and sales pitches to their unique situations.

I also shot, produced, and edited video interviews, segments, and livestreams.</p>

    <h3>Receiving Manager</h3>
